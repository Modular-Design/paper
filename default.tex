\begin{abstract}
A central process in composite lightweight engineering is the design of different fibre-reinforced parts. Some sub-processes such as the construction and numerical failure analysis as well as certain parts of the design process itself can be significantly improved using modern software tools. This often means that a compromise between optimization and increasing development costs must be found in order to balance structural complexity, number of design iteration loops and subsequent changes in the requirements.
We introduce a computer-driven automation process for a multi-domain, parameter-driven design optimization. The proposed concept was built around the idea that the methodology can be used with different software tools that are already in operation in the design process of lightweight structures and therefore allows an easy implementation in already existing development chains.
The developed process was successfully applied to different design scenarios, for example for designing GFRP rotors with respect to their structural dynamics performance. The results show promising time savings during the design phase and allow to quickly adapt the design to subsequent changes in the optimization goal.
