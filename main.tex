\begin{abstract}
% Vorschlag Felix:
To determine the probability of failure for the brittle materials, the 'principle of independent action' (pia) method can be used with stresses calculated by Finite Element (FE) simulations. In this work different methods for implementing the pia method into existing fem programs are evaluated in terms of computational error and effort. It could be shown, that the commonly used normal stress averaging (NSA) should not be used and should replaced with high order integration techniques. Further, the effect of different Weibull parameters on the performance as well as a method to artificially increase the precision are shown in this paper. The results can be used to determine the best method for a particular use case scenario.

% "alte Version"
Evaluating components using \ac{fem} based algorithms is a standard practise and is
therefore also used for the evaluation of brittle materials. In this work, different 
methods for implementing the \ac*{pia} method into existing \ac{fem} programs are evaluated. Their advantages and disadvantages, mainly the computational error and effort, are analyzed and compared by numerical simulations. 
In particular, it shows that the commonly used \ac*{nsa} approach should not be used and should replaced with high order integration techniques.
Further, the effect of different Weibull parameters on the performance as well as a method to artificially increase the precision are shown in this paper. The results can be used to determine the best method for a particular use case scenario.
